# Quick Start

### Create a new environment
An environment represents an accessing entity, which can be either a `user` or a `service`. For now, we’ll create an environment associated with the current user and register it to the development machine that is in use.

> You’ll be prompted to create and confirm a password. This password will be required to access the environment later, so be sure to remember it.
```bash
slv env new self --name kuwan --email kuwan@example.com --tags cats --tags pets
```
#### Output
```
Public Key:      SLV_EPK_AEAUKAAAACBGNPQ5ORZWPBM6AG3C7IYC57NMQIXIXCTN2GWE422PBAQMWQ5AE
Name:            kuwan
Email:           kuwan@example.com
Tags:            [cats pets]

Successfully registered as self environment
Please note down the "Secret Binding" somewhere safe so that you don't lose it.
It is required to access your registered environment.
```

### Create a new vault
A vault stores secrets in encrypted format in SLV. Let’s quickly create one that’s accessible to the environment we just set up.
```bash
slv vault new --vault test.slv.yaml --env-self
```
#### Output
```
Created vault: test.slv.yaml
```
The vault has been created and can be accessed by the environment we just created.

### Add a secret to the vault
Now that the vault has been created, let's try to add a secret to the vault.
```bash
slv vault put --vault test.slv.yaml --name my_cat --value "is_pawsome"
```
#### Output
```
Successfully added/updated secret my_cat into the vault test.slv.yaml
```

### Retrieve the secret from the vault
Now that we have a secret in the vault, let's try to read it.
> You will be prompted to enter the password you set when creating the environment, and asked if you’d like to save it to your keychain for future use.
```bash
slv vault get --vault test.slv.yaml --name my_cat
```
#### Output
```
is_pawsome
```

> Alternatively, you can inject the secret into your environment variables. This approach is particularly useful when you want to access secrets in your code locally during testing.
```bash
slv vault shell --vault test.slv.yaml
```
#### Output
```
Initialized SLV session with secrets loaded as environment variables from the vault test.slv.yaml.
```
> Once set, the secrets will be available as environment variables and accessible to your application at runtime.
```bash
echo $my_cat
```
#### Output
```
is_pawsome
```
